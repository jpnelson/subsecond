          Some people think React is easy to understand, and some people thing
          it's super difficult. How can both be true? I go over different
          approaches for explaining React, techniques for explaining more
          effectively, and some gotchas and pitfalls that people often

          If you can&#39;t measure it, you can&#39;t improve it. But measuring
          load time is easy, right? &quot;Load time&quot; is an outdated
          concept, as single page app experiences take over the web. We need
          better metrics to measure what our users are really feeling.
